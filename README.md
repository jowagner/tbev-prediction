# Treebank embedding vector prediction for out-of-domain dependency parsing

Over the coming weeks, before ACL 2020, we add cleaned-up code here to reproduce experiments of

Joachim Wagner, James Barry and Jennifer Foster (to appear, accepted at ACL 2020). Treebank Embedding Vectors for Out-of-domain Dependency Parsing. In Proceedings of the 2020 Annual Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.
